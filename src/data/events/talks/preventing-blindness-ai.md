    bio: Pedro Costa holds a MSc (2015) in Informatics and Computing Engineering at the Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto. Costa started working with INESC TEC in 2014 trying to find adverse drug reactions in biological data using Machine Learning. After a brief experience in the industry, Costa came back to INESC TEC to work on medical image processing using Deep Learning methods, having published several papers in top conferences and medical imaging journals. He then spent three months working on weakly supervised deep learning methods at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). Currently, he is Head of Research at Abyssal, working on how to improve Remotely Operated Vehicles’ operational efficiency using Machine Learning and Computer Vision techniques. He is also a researcher at INESC TEC and keeps cooperating with CMU on several projects.

Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of preventable blindness in the developed world, affecting more than 25% of the diabetic patients. Due to high social and economic impacts of blindness, most countries developed screening programmes to monitor the diabetic population for signs of DR. During screening, eye fundus images are acquired and examined by ophthalmologists. We developed an Artificial Intelligence method to automatically classifies the quality of the images, detects signs of DR and decides if a patient should be treated or not. We show that our model has comparable performance to some ophthalmologists and attains the required performance of screening programmes. This method has the potential of reducing the ophthalmologists’ burden, helping them focus on the treatment of the affected patients, with the ultimate goal of reducing the number of DR related blindness.
