While there has been a lot of buzz in the news and social media about algorithmic bias and fairness, the discussions are still very superficial and very little action has been taken to understand what happens across different domains in practice, and what tradeoffs and possible solutions should be used. In this talk, we are going to dive into this problem, from metrics and definitions to practical case studies in real policy problems where AI is being used to complement and even replace human expert decision-making.
